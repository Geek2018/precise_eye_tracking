# precise_eye_tracking

First needed to blur
Things to look into: 1. Kaiman Filter
                     2. Mean shift

The key is to downscale the images thence the run time of the hough transform would increase exponentially!!!!!!!!!

And don't find hough transform for every picture, only thouse at the timne of the eye movement!!!!

See if there is a way to auto-threshold a picture to get the best hough transform result.
